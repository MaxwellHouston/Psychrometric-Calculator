# Psychrometric Calculator

## About
This web app is a calculator that takes in two inputs of either: Temperature, Dew Point, or Relative Humidity. It then solves for the input type not used. The main use for this web app is to help make calculations for people working in the Water Mitigation field, or studying Psychrometrics.

## Build
I made this page using create-react-app. The files are Javascript and CSS.
